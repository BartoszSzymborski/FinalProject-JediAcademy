Final Project – Jedi Academy

1. Description:
My final project druing boot camp in Coderslab. My idea was to create simple application where you can become Jedi Knight, by using simple forms where you can customize your choose (light saber color, fight form, etc.). 

To better understanding what is Jedi Academy I add some useful descriptions. You can see it on main page of project or during using application. 

I did this project, because Star Wars is of my hobbies. 

In this project I focused to using technologies that we used during course. Mostly I concentrated to use Spring, Hiberniate, MySQL. I also used Bootstrap and CSS. 
2. Technologies used
* Java – 1.8
* Spring (MVC, JPA, Data, JSP, Validation)
* Hibernate
* Bootstrap
* CSS
* MySQL
* IDEA Ultimate
3. Functionality:
With my app you can become a Jedi Knight by using simple forms to fulfill:
- Data choose
- Color of light saber + description
- Fight form + description
- Teacher + description
- Opinion about school
4. Future
I would like, in future to add Spring Security, Mail or SMS sender and User and Admin panel to my application.
