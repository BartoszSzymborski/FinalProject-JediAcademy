            <h1>Light Saber</h1>
            <div>
                <p>
                    The lightsaber, sometimes referred to as a laser sword, was a weapon used by the Jedi, the Sith, and other Force-sensitives. Lightsabers consist of a plasma blade, powered by a kyber crystal, that was emitted from a usually metal hilt and could be shut off at will. It was a weapon that required skill and training, and was greatly enhanced when used in conjunction with the Force. Though also used by the Sith, the lightsaber was synonymous with the Jedi, with some in the galaxy believing only Jedi could use lightsabers.

                    Lightsabers were generally used for both offense and defense. A lightsaber could cut through virtually anything, from enemies to blast doors. The only ways to block the incoming attack of a lightsaber was with a weapon made with material that conducted energy, such as an electrostaff, Z6 riot control baton, some rare metals or simply another lightsaber. When used defensively, a Force-sensitive could deflect blaster bolts with a lightsaber, and with skill, could even reflect the shots back toward the shooter or some other target. Experienced Jedi could even employ their lightsabers to absorb Force lightning. Most practitioners used one single-bladed lightsaber, though some used double-bladed lightsabers or even multiple lightsabers at once.

            <h3>Blue Color  </h3>
            <p>
                Blue: probably the most standard color for a Jedi lightsaber. Used by Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker.
            </p>
            <div></div><br>
            <h3>Green Color </h3>
            <p>
                a secondary Jedi blade color of equal significance to blue. Used by Luke Skywalker, Qui-Gon Jinn, and Yoda.
            </p>
            <div></div><br>
            <h3>Red Color</h3>
            <p>
                Evil Force users wield red-bladed weapons because of the synthetic Kyber crystals at their core. Used by Darth Vader, Darth Maul, Darth Sidious, Count Dooku, Inquisitors, and Kylo Ren.
            </p>

            <div></div><br>
            <h3>Purple Color </h3>
           <p>
               Purple: a rare lightsaber color seen on only a few Jedi blades. Best known for its use by Mace Windu.
           </p>

            <div></div><br>
            <h3>Yellow Color</h3>
            <p>
                Double-bladed yellow sabers are used exclusively by Jedi Temple Guards.
            </p>

            <div></div><br>
            <h3>Black Color </h3>
           <p>
               There is only one "Darksaber," as it's known, and it's an ancient weapon stolen from the Jedi hundreds of years prior to the Clone Wars by the Mandalorians. Even more distinctive than its color is the Darksaber's a flat, curved blade resembling a real sword. It eventually came into the possession of Darth Maul during the Clone Wars, but its current whereabouts are unknown.
           </p>
            <div></div><br>
            <h3>White Color </h3>
            <p>
                Ahsoka Tano was the first character to wield white-bladed sabers (as an adult, on "Star Wars Rebels"). The story of how she acquired white Kyber crystals has yet to be told.
