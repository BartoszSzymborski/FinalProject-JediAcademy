            <h3>Yoda </h3>
           <p>
               Yoda, a Force-sensitive male member of a mysterious species, was a legendary Jedi Master who witnessed the rise and fall of the Galactic Republic, as well as the rise of the Galactic Empire. An ancient Jedi revered for his advanced age and wisdom, Yoda served as Grand Master of the Jedi Order during the latter days of the Republic and also held a seat on the Jedi High Council along with other legendary masters such as Mace Windu and Ki-Adi-Mundi. For over eight-hundred years he mentored others in the ways of the Force and had a hand in the training of many Jedi during their time as younglings.

               Obi-Wan Kenobi, later known as Ben Kenobi during his exile, was a Force-sensitive human male Jedi Master who served the Galactic Republic. He was a mentor and close friend to both Anakin Skywalker and his son, Luke, training them in the ways of the Force.

            <h3>Mace Windu</h3>
            <p>
                Mace Windu, a Force-sensitive human male, was a revered Jedi Master and member of the Jedi High Council during the last years of the Galactic Republic. During his time in the Jedi Order, he once served as elected leader of the Jedi and, during the Clone Wars, as a Jedi General in the Grand Army of the Republic. He was the greatest champion of the Jedi Order and promoted its ancient traditions amidst the growing influence of the dark side of the Force in the corrupt, declining days of the Republic.

            <h3>Anakin Skywalker </h3>
            <p>
                Anakin Skywalker, a Force-sensitive human male, was a Jedi Knight of the Galactic Republic and the Chosen One of the Force. During the Clone Wars, his accomplishments as a battlefield commander earned him the Hero With No Fear moniker. After turning to the dark side of the Force, he became known as Darth Vaderâ€”Dark Lord of the Sith and apprentice to Emperor Darth Sidious. As a Sith Lord, Vader turned against his former comrades and hunted the surviving Jedi into near extinction. He became an enforcer of the Galactic Empire, who worked to crush the Alliance to Restore the Republic for opposing his Sith Master's will. Yet despite his actions as Darth Vader, a glimmer of the light side of the Force remained within the former Anakin Skywalker.

            <h3>Qui-Gon Jinn </h3>
            <p>
                Qui-Gon Jinn was a human male Jedi Master who lived during the declining days of the Galactic Republic. The Coruscant-born Jedi was a controversial figure in his time, having long been a student of the Living Force who often bucked the Jedi Code and the decisions of the Jedi High Council in order to follow the will of the Force. According to his Padawan, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Jinn could have been a member of the High Council had he followed the Code, but he, like his own Jedi Master, Count Dooku, did not always put his faith in institutional wisdom. His studies of the Living Force helped him learn to unlock the secrets of eternal consciousness after death, giving him and the students he would later teach influence beyond death.
