            <h1>Force - what is it?</h1>
            <p>
                The Living Force represented the energies of all lifeforms, and those energies were fed into the Cosmic Force that bound the galaxy together and communicated to individuals through the midi-chlorians. Though only certain individuals were Force-sensitive, the Force resided within all living things and could be extracted. Because of this, Force-sensitives could feel a "disturbance in the Force" whenever there was a great loss of life. Droids, however, being mechanical creations, and thus possessing no midi-chlorians, could never sense the Force.

            <p>
                Usage of the Force granted a number of useful powers, such as the ability to sense impending attacks; to push, lift, and otherwise manipulate physical objects; to influence the minds of others; to sedate or induce sleep; and even see the future or maintain one's consciousness after death. A powerful Force-sensitive individual could conjure lightning from their hands and fingers. The Jedi taught younglings that the Force could be used for many purposes, including protection, persuasion, wisdom, the manipulation of matter and the performance of great physical feats.
