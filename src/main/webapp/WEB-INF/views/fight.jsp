           <p>

            <h3>Form V </h3>
          <p>
              Form V, also known as Djem So or Shien (pronounced shee-ENN), was the fifth form of lightsaber combat used by members of the Jedi Order. Form V allowed a Jedi to deflect blaster fire back at an opponent, turning the Jedi's defense into an offensive action. The Djem So variant of Form V was also based on defending with solid blocks and parries, then immediately countering with strong counterattacks and ripostes, and was geared toward and created for lightsaber-to-lightsaber combat, but also still reasonably useful for blast deflection.
